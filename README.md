# Illegal_Services/dev-utilities

In the near future, this branch will includes all the scripts that I'm using in order to maintain Illegal Services project in what is, it's current state. (this includes scanners for dead or changed domain scanners, utilizes that makes it easy to works all together with bookmarks, etc ...)

For now as I'm not yet ready to publish publicly those privately developped scripts, I will only link projects that I often use that are mostly made from other developpers.

Stuff developped from myself are notted from my dev name: IB_U_Z_Z_A_R_Dl

So those that doesn't contain a clickable links are just still not yet ready to be published publicly.
